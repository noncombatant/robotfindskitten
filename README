IMPORTANT! robotfindskitten will NOT compile properly unless the ncurses
headers are installed (libncursesN-dev in Debian GNU/Linux; installed by
default with Xcode on Mac OS X).

To compile, make sure you have the ncurses libraries installed, and simply
type "./make".

To install, do the preceeding and then copy the robotfindskitten binary to a
place in your $PATH. A good place might be $HOME/bin, /usr/games, or
/usr/local/games.

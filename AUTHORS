I (leonardr@segfault.org) wrote this program.

Pete Peterson (pedro@zork.net) supplied about [many] non-kitten messages.

Frederick Lee (phaethon@csua.ucla.edu) showed me how to get my beloved IBM
character set under Linux.

Some ncurses initialization code stolen from “Writing Programs With NCURSES”
by Eric S. Raymond and Zeyd M. Ben-Halim
(http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-intro.html).

Nick Moffitt (nick@zork.net) and George Moffitt (zen@zork.net) refactored the
code and added new key commands as well as non-kitten messages.

Rewritten and © 2004 – 2005 Alexey Toptygin <alexeyt@freeshell.org>. Based on
sources by Leonard Richardson and others.

Chris Palmer (https://noncombatant.org) significantly rewrote it to be simpler
and to not require GNU Autotools.

1 The Niceties
**************

Hi there. This is the documentation file for robotfindskitten, winner
(by default) of the first Nerth Pork webzine robotfindskitten contest.
The object of the contest was to create a work of art whose title
and/or theme was "robotfindskitten". I chose to write this program,
which is a Zen simulation. That's what Nerth Pork editor Pete Peterson
calls it, and that's really the best way to describe it, even though
"Zen simulation" sounds kinda pretentious.  Anyway, let's dispense with
the niceties and get on with the documentation.

2 The Documentation
*******************

In this simulation, you play the part of robot. Your task is to
complete the simulation by finding kitten, as is your destiny, and
indeed your wont.  You (robot) are represented by the # character, and
you move around with the arrow keys (Nethack, EMACS, or otherwise)
touching things.  If the thing you touch is kitten, you get a cute
little animation (which was cuter in the DOS version) and the simulation
ends. Otherwise, you get a brief description of what it is you touched.

2.1 The Parts of the Simulation
===============================

The first part of the simulation is the command line used to invoke it.
It is here where you can control the number of non-kitten objects on
the screen in any one instance of the simulation. To exercise this
control, simply use the -n option on the command line. For instance, to
play with 32 objects on the screen, you would invoke the program with
the command `robotfindskitten -n 32' (or, more likely,
`./robotfindskitten -n 32'). The default is twenty non-kitten objects.

   The second part of the simulation is the title screen. It should be
fairly self-explanatory.

   The third part of the simulation is the actual simulation itself. The
long line near the top of the screen separates the screen into the
field of play and the status bar. The status bar displays messages and
item descriptions.  Just so you don't wonder what that line is.

   The fourth part of the simulation... there isn't one. It's not a very
complicated simulation.

2.2 Controls
============

  1. To move robot, use the arrow keys. Diagonals now work! Nethack
     arrow keys (including diagonals) now work! Now that's innovation!
     EMACS keys work, too.

  2. To touch an object, make a move as if you were trying to occupy
     the square currently occupied by the object you want to touch.
     Sorry if that seemed obvious, but you never know. I don't want to
     be accused of writing incomplete documentation.

  3. If you want to end the program for whatever reason, just hit 'q'
     or a good old-fashioned Control-C.

Danger!

4 Another Word of Warning
*************************

The characters you see on the screen are not guaranteed to correspond
in shape or color to what the descriptions say they are. In fact,
they're pretty much guaranteed not to. If there was any consistency,
it'd be pretty easy to spot kitten every time, now wouldn't it?

5 Technical Information for Hard-Core Geeks
*******************************************

The original robotfindskitten (the one that won the contest) was
written using Borland Turbo C++ 3.0 for DOS in 1997. I ported it to
(rewrote it for, more like) Linux over Independance Day, 1999. It now
uses the ncurses library. Version 1600003 is written for ncurses 5.0,
which is what I have on my Mandrake system. It's good that you're a
hard-core geek like me. I can speak frankly to you, knowing that
non-coders won't read this section, or will be scared off by all that
jargon in the first few sentences. Our plan is nearly complete, and we
are poised to take our rightful places as rulers of this planet.
Already we control the technology of the sheeplike masses. We merely
await the command from Geek Central, and Earth will be ours! AH HA HA
HA HA HA! Uh-oh, that evil laughing looks kind of conspicuous in a doc
file. I better put in some more technical info. If you want to write
your own ncurses game, you can use the framework provided by
robotfindskitten or the more flexible framework provided by the sequel
(also on my software page). Now, let us part with the secret geek
handshake!

**************************************************

I want robotfindskitten to be the most comprehensive Zen simulation on
the market. But for that to happen, I need your help. Please, send in
any descriptions of objects you would like to see in robotfindskitten
to <leonardr@ucla.edu>. Heck, you could even tell me to put you in the
program!  I'm certainly not above that sort of thing. Pete Peterson set
a great example by providing over 30 objects for everone's
kitten-finding enjoyment. Also, be sure to tell me how you like
robotfindskitten.

   In addition, robotfindskitten has a project on Sourceforge!  Simply
visit `http://sourceforge.net/projects/rfk' and have a look at our bug
tracking system, bickering flame war mailing lists, and
haphazardly-branched repository trees!

7 BEHOLD! A History of Confusion
********************************

The original DOS version of robotfindskitten, now lost to humanity
unless there's an undiscovered copy lurking on one of Leonard
Richardson's hard drives, dates back to 1997.

   Leonard ported the code to Linux in 1999; that release is now fondly
remembered as "The Leonard R Kung Fu Grip" and the tarball can still be
found on in the project file area on Sourceforge.  It had 201 NKIs.

   In 2000, Peter Peterson released "Uncle Pedro's Oldies Bonanza".
That version had the same 201 NKIs.

   In 2001, Nick Moffit autoconfiscated the code and began a CVS
history.  His release, the "MonkeyMaster Remix", had 248 NKIs.

   In 2003, Neale Pickett shipped "Neale's 2000-Inch Release" with 349
NKIs.

   In 2005, Alexey Toptygin rewrote the code to handle external files of
NKIs rather than having them inline in a string array. The devteam
agreed to adopt this version.  Then, in a fine example of the slack and
desultory style of robotfindskitten development, everybody (including
Alexey) wandered off and forgot about it.  The code wouldn't be merged
into the repo until just after it could have been declared legally dead.

   In 2007, Ryan Finnie shipped "rfk Rises From The Dead!". As Ryan was
blissfully unaware of the project repo, he shipped a tarball based on
the 2003 code with some minor fixes and 406 NKIs.  This code wouldn't
be merged into the repo until five years later.

   In 2012, Eric S. Raymond learned of the supernal awesomeness that is
robotfundskitten.  Approaching the somnolent (indeed, nigh-catatonic)
devteam, he offered to convert the repo to something less awful than CVS
and gather together the scattered threads of the project's history.
This he did, grafting on the Finnie and Toptygin releases.  He also
added some NKIs, polished the interface, and wrote this section you're
reading.

   The releases done after the turn of the 21st century use a naming
scheme that ends with the number of NKIs wired into the code or
available in the shipped NKI file.

Appendix A A Final Thought
**************************

     Day and night I feverishly worked upon the machine, creating both
     a soul which could desire its goal, and a body with which it could
     realize it. Many who saw my creation called it an abomination, and
     denied me grant money. But they could not dissuade me from my
     impossible task. It was a spectre that tormented me always, a
     ghost I had to give a form and a life, lest it consume me from the
     inside. And when at last my task was done, when the grey box on
     wheels was complete and when it, as well as I, knew what had to be
     done, I felt deep sympathy for the machine. For I had not
     destroyed the phantom, but merely exorcized it into another body.
     The robot knew not why this task had to be performed, for I could
     not imbue it with knowledge I did not myself posess. And at the
     same time, I felt a sweeping sense of relief sweep over me, that
     somehow, the dream that had driven me for my entire life had come
     one step closer to fruition.

     As I vocally activated the robot, I realized that it was following
     my instructions, but not out of any desire to obey me. Had I
     remained silent, it would have performed exactly the same
     operations. We were two beings controlled by the same force now.
     And yet, seeking vainly to hold some illusion of control over the
     machine I thought I had created, I gave my final command.

     `GO!' I told the box as it began to roll out of my workshop into
     the frozen desert beyond. `FIND KITTEN!'

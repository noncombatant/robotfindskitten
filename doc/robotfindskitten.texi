@cindex Zen simulation

Hi there. This is the documentation file for robotfindskitten, winner
(by default) of the first Nerth Pork webzine robotfindskitten
contest. The object of the contest was to create a work of art whose
title and/or theme was "robotfindskitten". I chose to write this
program, which is a Zen simulation. That's what Nerth Pork editor Pete
Peterson calls it, and that's really the best way to describe it, even
though "Zen simulation" sounds kinda pretentious.  Anyway, let's
dispense with the niceties and get on with the documentation.

In this simulation, you play the part of robot. Your task is to
complete the simulation by finding kitten, as is your destiny, and
indeed your wont.  You (robot) are represented by the # character, and
you move around with the arrow keys (Nethack, EMACS, or otherwise) touching
things.  If the thing you touch is kitten, you get a cute little
animation (which was cuter in the DOS version) and the simulation
ends. Otherwise, you get a brief description of what it is you
touched.

@section The Parts of the Simulation

@cindex non-kitten objects

The first part of the simulation is the command line used to invoke
it. It is here where you can control the number of non-kitten objects on
the screen in any one instance of the simulation. To exercise this
control, simply use the -n option on the command line. For instance, to
play with 32 objects on the screen, you would invoke the program with
the command @command{robotfindskitten -n 32} (or, more likely,
@command{./robotfindskitten -n 32}). The default is twenty non-kitten
objects.

@cindex title screen
The second part of the simulation is the title screen. It should be
fairly self-explanatory.

The third part of the simulation is the actual simulation itself. The
long line near the top of the screen separates the screen into the
field of play and the status bar. The status bar displays messages and
item descriptions.  Just so you don't wonder what that line is.

The fourth part of the simulation... there isn't one. It's not a very
complicated simulation.

To move robot, use the arrow keys. Diagonals now work! Nethack arrow keys (including diagonals) now work! Now that's innovation! EMACS keys work, too.

@cindex touch
@item
To touch an object, make a move as if you were trying to occupy the square
currently occupied by the object you want to touch. Sorry if that seemed
obvious, but you never know. I don't want to be accused of writing incomplete
documentation.

@cindex ending the simulation prematurely
@item
If you want to end the program for whatever reason, just hit 'q'
or a good old-fashioned Control-C.

@cindex warning
The characters you see on the screen are not guaranteed to correspond
in shape or color to what the descriptions say they are. In fact,
they're pretty much guaranteed not to. If there was any consistency,
it'd be pretty easy to spot kitten every time, now wouldn't it?

@cindex Isn't it fun reading through the index?
The original robotfindskitten (the one that won the contest) was
written using Borland Turbo C++ 3.0 for DOS in 1997. I ported it to
(rewrote it for, more like) Linux over Independance Day, 1999. It now
uses the ncurses library. Version 1600003 is written for ncurses 5.0,
which is what I have on my Mandrake system. It's good that you're a
hard-core geek like me. I can speak frankly to you, knowing that
non-coders won't read this section, or will be scared off by all that
jargon in the first few sentences. Our plan is nearly complete, and we
are poised to take our rightful places as rulers of this
planet. Already we control the technology of the sheeplike masses. We
merely await the command from Geek Central, and Earth will be ours! AH
HA HA HA HA HA! Uh-oh, that evil laughing looks kind of conspicuous in
a doc file. I better put in some more technical info. If you want to
write your own ncurses game, you can use the framework provided by
robotfindskitten or the more flexible framework provided by the sequel
(also on my software page). Now, let us part with the secret geek
handshake!

I want robotfindskitten to be the most comprehensive Zen simulation on
the market. But for that to happen, I need your help. Please, send in
any descriptions of objects you would like to see in robotfindskitten
to @email{leonardr@@ucla.edu}. Heck, you could even tell me to put you in the
program!  I'm certainly not above that sort of thing. Pete Peterson
set a great example by providing over 30 objects for everone's
kitten-finding enjoyment. Also, be sure to tell me how you like
robotfindskitten.

@cindex supernal awesomeness

The original DOS version of robotfindskitten, now lost to humanity
unless there's an undiscovered copy lurking on one of Leonard
Richardson's hard drives, dates back to 1997. 

Leonard ported the code to Linux in 1999; that release is now fondly
remembered as ``The Leonard R Kung Fu Grip'' and the tarball can still
be found on in the project file area on Sourceforge.  It had 201 NKIs.

In 2000, Peter Peterson released ``Uncle Pedro's Oldies Bonanza''.
That version had the same 201 NKIs.

In 2001, Nick Moffit autoconfiscated the code and began a CVS history.
His release, the ``MonkeyMaster Remix'', had 248 NKIs.

In 2003, Neale Pickett shipped ``Neale's 2000-Inch Release'' with 349
NKIs.

In 2005, Alexey Toptygin rewrote the code to handle external files of
NKIs rather than having them inline in a string array. The devteam 
agreed to adopt this version.  Then, in a fine example of the slack and
desultory style of robotfindskitten development, everybody (including
Alexey) wandered off and forgot about it.  The code wouldn't be merged
into the repo until just after it could have been declared legally dead.

In 2007, Ryan Finnie shipped ``rfk Rises From The Dead!''. As Ryan was
blissfully unaware of the project repo, he shipped a tarball based on
the 2003 code with some minor fixes and 406 NKIs.  This code wouldn't
be merged into the repo until five years later.

In 2012, Eric S. Raymond learned of the supernal awesomeness that is
robotfundskitten.  Approaching the somnolent (indeed, nigh-catatonic)
devteam, he offered to convert the repo to something less awful than CVS
and gather together the scattered threads of the project's history.
This he did, grafting on the Finnie and Toptygin releases.  He also
added some NKIs, polished the interface, and wrote this section you're
reading.

The releases done after the turn of the 21st century use a naming scheme
that ends with the number of NKIs wired into the code or available in
the shipped NKI file.

@appendix A Final Thought

@quotation
Day and night I feverishly worked upon the machine, creating both a soul which
could desire its goal, and a body with which it could realize it. Many who saw
my creation called it an abomination, and denied me grant money. But they could
not dissuade me from my impossible task. It was a spectre that tormented me
always, a ghost I had to give a form and a life, lest it consume me from the
inside. And when at last my task was done, when the grey box on wheels was
complete and when it, as well as I, knew what had to be done, I felt deep
sympathy for the machine. For I had not destroyed the phantom, but merely
exorcized it into another body. The robot knew not why this task had to be
performed, for I could not imbue it with knowledge I did not myself posess. And
at the same time, I felt a sweeping sense of relief sweep over me, that
somehow, the dream that had driven me for my entire life had come one step
closer to fruition.

@cindex Gort, Klaatu Verada Nikto
As I vocally activated the robot, I realized that it was following my
instructions, but not out of any desire to obey me. Had I remained silent, it
would have performed exactly the same operations. We were two beings controlled
by the same force now. And yet, seeking vainly to hold some illusion of control
over the machine I thought I had created, I gave my final command.

@cindex find kitten
`GO!' I told the box as it began to roll out of my workshop into the frozen
desert beyond. `FIND KITTEN!'
